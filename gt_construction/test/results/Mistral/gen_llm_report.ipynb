Your task is to assess the developer's intent in a given commit message and code diff, and categorize it into one of the following predefined categories based on its content:\n",
    "                      \n",
    "'Yes': A commit message and code diff that explicitly mention or demonstrate performance improvement or optimization, specifically in terms of execution time or resource utilization. The message or diff should clearly indicate actions that made the code run faster or more efficiently, use less memory, or more efficiently utilize system resources. This includes optimizations like replacing inefficient code patterns that are known to kill performance even if the message does not use the words 'improvement' or 'performance' explicitly. The diff may show changes such as algorithmic improvements, memory management enhancements, reduced computational complexity, or better resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "'No': A commit message and code diff that do not pertain to performance enhancements. This includes changes related to testing, documentation, performance profiling/monitoring/debugging/analysis, and bug/error/crash fixes that don't explicitly mention performance improvement of the application itself. Also, code refactoring or feature addition without explicit performance optimization, and mentions of necessary, speculative, or potential performance enhancements without concrete evidence or results. Any message or diff that is irrelevant, unclear, ambiguous, or does not provide enough context to determine its intent should also be classified as 'No'. Additionally, pay close attention to the context in which terms like 'performance', 'improve', or 'improvements' are used. Not all improvements are related to performance—only classify a message as 'Yes' if it specifically mentions enhancements related to execution time, memory usage, or resource efficiency. Avoid making assumptions based on ambiguous terms. You should have high confidence in classifying a message as 'Yes' based on careful examination of the information provided in the commit message and code diff.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the commit message and code diff contain multiple intentions, where at least one of those intentions includes a performance improvement, classify the entire commit as 'Yes'.\n",
