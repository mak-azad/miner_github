"sync: don't block the flusher thread waiting on IO  When sync does it's WB_SYNC_ALL writeback, it issues data Io and then immediately waits for IO completion. This is done in the context of the flusher thread, and hence completely ties up the flusher thread for the backing device until all the dirty inodes have been synced. On filesystems that are dirtying inodes constantly and quickly, this means the flusher thread can be tied up for minutes per sync call and hence badly affect system level write IO performance as the page cache cannot be cleaned quickly.  We already have a wait loop for IO completion for sync(2), so cut this out of the flusher thread and delegate it to wait_sb_inodes(). Hence we can do rapid IO submission, and then wait for it all to complete.

"mm: hugetlbfs: fix hugetlbfs optimization  commit 27c73ae759774e63313c1fbfeb17ba076cea64c5 upstream.  Commit 7cb2ef56e6a8 (""mm: fix aio performance regression for database caused by THP"") can cause dereference of a dangling pointer if split_huge_page runs during PageHuge() if there are updates to the tail_page->private field.  Also it is repeating compound_head twice for hugetlbfs and it is running compound_head+compound_trans_head for THP when a single one is needed in both cases.  The new code within the PageSlab() check doesn't need to verify that the THP page size is never bigger than the smallest hugetlbfs page size, to avoid memory corruption.  A longstanding theoretical race condition was found while fixing the above (see the change right after the skip_unlock label, that is relevant for the compound_lock path too).

"Add prefetch option for queries, which defaults to false for inserts (#6077)  ## What is the goal of this PR?    On executing a Graql query, Grakn automatically streams the first batch of responses back to the client. This ensures they get their answers to a `match` query as fast as possible. But, for an `insert` query, they usually don't need those answers. And the CPU cost of compiling these unwanted response messages was inflicting a significant performance penalty. To remedy this, we made `prefetch` a configurable per-query option, which defaults to true, except for Insert queries where it defaults to false.    ## What are the changes implemented in this PR?    - Don't prefetch responses to Insert queries unless specified with a configurable flag in QueryOptions (fixes [URL]/graknlabs/grakn/issues/6072)",1,1

"f2fs: improve write performance under frequent fsync calls  When considering a bunch of data writes with very frequent fsync calls, we are able to think the following performance regression.

Then D3 and D4 would be delayed, resuling in performance degradation.

"Make THaVarList a THashList instead of a TList for better performance.  (Almost) everything just happens automagically as we inherit from THashList instead of TList. THaVarList::Find(const char* name) automatically makes hash table lookups, vastly improving the search speed if a large number of global variables is defined.  Also, make THaVarList the owner of its objects, so as the list is deleted, so are all of its elements. This was already the previous behavior; this just eliminates duplicate code.  Closes #27.",1,1
"lowmemorykiller: adapt to vmpressure  There were issues reported, where page cache thrashing was observed because of LMK not killing tasks when required, resulting in sluggishness and higher app launch latency. LMK does not kill a task for the following reasons. 1. The free and file pages are above the LMK thresholds 2. LMK tries to pick task with an adj level corresponding to current thresholds, but fails to do so because of the absence of tasks in that level. But sometimes it is better to kill a lower adj task, than thrashing. And there are cases where the number of file pages are huge, though we dont thrash, the reclaim process becomes time consuming, since LMK triggers will be delayed because of higher number of file pages. Even in such cases, when reclaim path finds it difficult to reclaim pages, it is better to trigger lmk to free up some memory faster.  The basic idea here is to make LMK more aggressive dynamically when such a thrashing scenario is detected.  To detect thrashing, this patch uses vmpressure events. The values of vmpressure upon which an action has to be taken, was derived empirically.  This patch also adds tracepoints to validate this feature, almk_shrink and almk_vmpressure.  Two knobs are available for the user to tune adaptive lmk behaviour.  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adaptive_lmk - Write 1 to enable the feature, 0 to disable. By default disabled.  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/vmpressure_file_min - This parameter controls the behaviour of LMK when vmpressure is in the range of 90-94. Adaptive lmk triggers based on number file pages wrt vmpressure_file_min, when vmpressure is in the range of 90-94. Usually this is a pseudo minfree value, higher than the highest configured value in minfree array.",1,1
"mutex: Queue mutex spinners with MCS lock to reduce cacheline contention  The current mutex spinning code (with MUTEX_SPIN_ON_OWNER option turned on) allow multiple tasks to spin on a single mutex concurrently. A potential problem with the current approach is that when the mutex becomes available, all the spinning tasks will try to acquire the mutex more or less simultaneously. As a result, there will be a lot of cacheline bouncing especially on systems with a large number of CPUs.  This patch tries to reduce this kind of contention by putting the mutex spinners into a queue so that only the first one in the queue will try to acquire the mutex. This will reduce contention and allow all the tasks to move forward faster.  The queuing of mutex spinners is done using an MCS lock based implementation which will further reduce contention on the mutex cacheline than a similar ticket spinlock based implementation. This patch will add a new field into the mutex data structure for holding the MCS lock. This expands the mutex size by 8 bytes for 64-bit system and 4 bytes for 32-bit system. This overhead will be avoid if the MUTEX_SPIN_ON_OWNER option is turned off.  The following table shows the jobs per minute (JPM) scalability data on an 8-node 80-core Westmere box with a 3.7.10 kernel. The numactl command is used to restrict the running of the fserver workloads to 1/2/4/8 nodes with hyperthreading off.  +-----------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+----------+ |  Configuration  | Mean JPM  | Mean JPM  |  Mean JPM   | % Change | |                 | w/o patch | patch 1   | patches 1&2 |  1->1&2  | +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+ |                 |              User Range 1100 - 2000            | +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+ | 8 nodes, HT off |  227972   |  227237   |   305043    |  +34.2%  | | 4 nodes, HT off |  393503   |  381558   |   394650    |   +3.4%  | | 2 nodes, HT off |  334957   |  325240   |   338853    |   +4.2%  | | 1 node , HT off |  198141   |  197972   |   198075    |   +0.1%  | +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+ |                 |              User Range 200 - 1000             | +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+ | 8 nodes, HT off |  282325   |  312870   |   332185    |   +6.2%  | | 4 nodes, HT off |  390698   |  378279   |   393419    |   +4.0%  | | 2 nodes, HT off |  336986   |  326543   |   340260    |   +4.2%  | | 1 node , HT off |  197588   |  197622   |   197582    |    0.0%  | +-----------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+----------+  At low user range 10-100, the JPM differences were within +/-1%. So they are not that interesting.  The fserver workload uses mutex spinning extensively. With just the mutex change in the first patch, there is no noticeable change in performance.  Rather, there is a slight drop in performance. This mutex spinning patch more than recovers the lost performance and show a significant increase of +30% at high user load with the full 8 nodes. Similar improvements were also seen in a 3.8 kernel.  The table below shows the %time spent by different kernel functions as reported by perf when running the fserver workload at 1500 users with all 8 nodes.  +-----------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+ |        Function       |  % time   | % time  |   % time    | |                       | w/o patch | patch 1 | patches 1&2 | +-----------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+ | __read_lock_failed    |  34.96%   | 34.91%  |   29.14%    | | __write_lock_failed   |  10.14%   | 10.68%  |    7.51%    | | mutex_spin_on_owner   |   3.62%   |  3.42%  |    2.33%    | | mspin_lock            |    N/A    |   N/A   |    9.90%    | | __mutex_lock_slowpath |   1.46%   |  0.81%  |    0.14%    | | _raw_spin_lock        |   2.25%   |  2.50%  |    1.10%    | +-----------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+  The fserver workload for an 8-node system is dominated by the contention in the read/write lock. Mutex contention also plays a role. With the first patch only, mutex contention is down (as shown by the __mutex_lock_slowpath figure) which help a little bit. We saw only a few percents improvement with that.  By applying patch 2 as well, the single mutex_spin_on_owner figure is now split out into an additional mspin_lock figure. The time increases from 3.42% to 11.23%. It shows a great reduction in contention among the spinners leading to a 30% improvement. The time ratio 9.9/2.33=4.3 indicates that there are on average 4+ spinners waiting in the spin_lock loop for each spinner in the mutex_spin_on_owner loop. Contention in other locking functions also go down by quite a lot.  The table below shows the performance change of both patches 1 & 2 over patch 1 alone in other AIM7 workloads (at 8 nodes, hyperthreading off).  +--------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+ |   Workload   | mean % change | mean % change  | mean % change   | |              | 10-100 users  | 200-1000 users | 1100-2000 users | +--------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+ | alltests     |      0.0%     |     -0.8%      |     +0.6%       | | five_sec     |     -0.3%     |     +0.8%      |     +0.8%       | | high_systime |     +0.4%     |     +2.4%      |     +2.1%       | | new_fserver  |     +0.1%     |    +14.1%      |    +34.2%       | | shared       |     -0.5%     |     -0.3%      |     -0.4%       | | short        |     -1.7%     |     -9.8%      |     -8.3%       | +--------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+  The short workload is the only one that shows a decline in performance probably due to the spinner locking and queuing overhead.

"Build support libs with AAPT2  Use AAPT2 to build the framework support libraries. Apps built with AAPT2 can more efficiently link against these libraries by specifying their module name in LOCAL_STATIC_ANDROID_LIBRARIES.

This change will not affect any apps that currently depend on the support libraries. This is because they import the resources directly.  We use LOCAL_JAR_EXCLUDE_FILES := none only to support javac when building javadoc. Jack builds are correct because the build system passes in the latest generated R.java ahead of any previous ones packaged in classes.jack. This means we can dynamically reference a support lib module, correctly seeing non-final R.java. Then at app package time, we only include the final R.java generated by the AAPT2 packaging step.

These initialization are either moved to the appropriate constructor(s), or removed them completely if they are redundant. Constants with the wrong modifiers are amended to have static final, and are allowed to be initialized directly.  As a side bonus, this patch offers a minor performance improvement, as some of these members are now only initialized once instead of twice (once in the member initialization and then again via a constructor parameter).

"[SYSTEMML-1683] Improved codegen row template (indexing, cbind)  This patch makes two improvements to the code generator row-wise template in order to further reduce the number of intermediates in scripts such as MLogreg as well as minor explain improvements):  (1) Column indexing support w/ unknown indexing expressions.  (2) Fusion of cbind with empty matrix after row-wise template (row aggregates).  (3) Extended explain to show the line numbers (of the original script) for generated operators.  For example, on MLogreg and a dense 100M x 10 scenario, this reduces the buffer pool writes from (76/30/1) to (60/30/1) and execution time from 282s to 256s (compared to the baseline w/ existing fused operators of 529s).   Note that there is substantial additional potential, which can be exploited to reduce the number evictions. However, this will be addressed in separate changes as it requires optimizer changes (e.g., considering multi-aggregates while considering materialization, and materialization points per consumer).",1,1

This can be a problem on small-memory systems, where the default 6-second sleep for CPUs having only lazy RCU callbacks could well be fatal.  This commit therefore installs an OOM hander that ensures that every CPU with lazy callbacks has at least one non-lazy callback, in turn ensuring timely advancement for these callbacks.  Updated to fix bug that disabled OOM killing, noted by Lai Jiangshan.  Updated to push the for_each_rcu_flavor() loop into rcu_oom_notify_cpu(), thus reducing the number of IPIs, as suggested by Steven Rostedt.  Also to make the for_each_online_cpu() loop be preemptible.  (Later, it might be good to use smp_call_function(), as suggested by Peter Zijlstra.)",1,1

"sched: reinitialize rq->next_balance when a CPU is hot-added  Reinitialize rq->next_balance when a CPU is hot-added.  Otherwise, scheduler domain rebalancing may be skipped if rq->next_balance was set to a future time when the CPU was last active, and the newly-re-added CPU is in idle_balance().  As a result, the newly-re-added CPU will remain idle with no tasks scheduled until the softlockup watchdog runs - potentially 4 seconds later.  This can waste energy and reduce performance.  This behavior can be observed in some SoC kernels, which use CPU hotplug to dynamically remove and add CPUs in response to load.  In one case that triggered this behavior,  0. the system started with all cores enabled, running multi-threaded    CPU-bound code;  1. the system entered some single-threaded code;  2. a CPU went idle and was hot-removed;  3. the system started executing a multi-threaded CPU-bound task;  4. the CPU from event 2 was re-added, to respond to the load.  The time interval between events 2 and 4 was approximately 300 milliseconds.  Of course, ideally CPU hotplug would not be used in this manner, but this patch does appear to fix a real bug.

"[SYSTEMML-1836] Reduced GC overhead codegen rowwise ops (static buffer)   Scripts like Kmeans and Mlogreg showed unnecessarily large GC overhead when ran with codegen enabled. These scripts heavily rely on rowwise fused operators, which already used a thread-local buffer for row intermediates (where the size of this buffer is derived from the cplan, usually <10). However, this ring buffer used a poor implementation based on linked lists, which created new objects per vector allocation (i.e., per row intermediate).   This patch changes this implementation to a static array ring buffer, which significantly improved end-to-end performance. For example, here are the results for Kmeans and Mlogreg on a 10Mx10 scenario:  Baselines w/o codegen: Kmeans 1,399s, Mlogreg 507s. Kmeans w/ codegen: 466s (102s GC) -> 326s (13s GC) Mlogreg w/ codegen: 196s (37s GC) -> 134s (6s GC)  Furthermore, this patch also cleans up the statistics collection (collect all outside loop and only for top-level problems), statistics output formatting (mis-aligned outputs), and introduces a new util function for integer power 2^x in order to increase readability while leveraging the performance benefits of simply shifts.",1,1

"Optimization (performance regression fix): Use bigger buffer for server reads.  Change the server read buffer limits to 16KB minimum and 256KB maximum. Used to be: 2KB and 2GB. And before r9766: 4KB and SQUID_TCP_SO_RCVBUF.  Trunk r9766 (Remove limit on HTTP headers read) made the default HTTP server read buffer size 2KB instead of 4KB, visibly slowing down Squid when kernel network buffers are full and can sustain larger Squid reads. Doing up to twice as many network reads is expensive (and probably not just because of the extra system call overheads).  We never grow that buffer size if the _parser_ does not need a bigger buffer:  Even if the HTTP client is slower than the server, the buffer stays small because it gives all the data to Store and Store eventually just stalls reading via delayAwareRead() and read_ahead_gap. The situation may be different with RESPMOD, but if the adaptation service is fast, the buffer would still not grow.  This change does not reset the minimum buffer size to the old 4KB default because memory is much cheaper compared to the days where that default was set. 8KB may have worked too, but with 12KB median typical response size a larger buffer may be a good idea for a busy Squid. More performance work is needed to find the optimal value (which could depend on the environment).  This change does not set the maximum buffer size to the current 2GB limit because we have not tested how header and chunking parsers would cope with malicious messages trying to run Squid out of RAM; and also because no good parser should need that much lookahead space. Is 256KB enough for all legitimate real-world response headers? We do not know.  It is tempting to use Config.tcpRcvBufsz or SQUID_TCP_SO_RCVBUF to find the right minimum or maximum buffer size, but those parameters deal with low-level TCP buffering aspects while this buffer deals with HTTP parsing.",1,1

The memory copy performance differs between different ARM64 platforms. And a more recent glibc (e.g. 2.23 or later) can provide a better memcpy() performance compared to old glibc versions.

It's not always proving better performance than memcpy() so users need to run DPDK unit test ""memcpy_perf_autotest"" and customize parameters in ""customization section"" in rte_memcpy_64.h for best performance.  Compiler version will also impact the rte_memcpy() performance. It's observed on some platforms and with the same code, GCC 7.2.0 compiled binary can provide better performance than GCC 4.8.5. It's suggested to use GCC 5.4.0 or later.",1,1

"gpu: ion: Set the dma_address of the sg list at alloc time  This patch sets the dma_address field of the sglist representing an allocation at allocation time.  This technically breaks the dma api which states that these addresses should be set when a particular device takes ownership of a buffer via the dma_map apis.  In the case of our systems the only dma address space is physical addresses.  Additionally, we can not afford the overhead of calling dma_map_sg from this location as it implies a cache invalidate that is not necessary if the memory was previously mapped cached.  Instead, the expectation is that memory being returned from the heaps is ready for dma in that if any cached mappings of that memory exist they have been invalidated.",0,0

"drm/i915: [GEN7] Use HW scheduler for fixed function shaders  commit a1e969e0332de7a430e62822cee8f2ec8d83cd7c upstream.  This originally started as a patch from Bernard as a way of simply setting the VS scheduler. After submitting the RFC patch, we decided to also modify the DS scheduler. To be most explicit, I've made the patch explicitly set all scheduler modes, and included the defines for other modes (in case someone feels frisky later).  The rest of the story gets a bit weird. The first version of the patch showed an almost unbelievable performance improvement. Since rebasing my branch it appears the performance improvement has gone, unfortunately. But setting these bits seem to be the right thing to do given that the docs describe corruption that can occur with the default settings.  In summary, I am seeing no more perf improvements (or regressions) in my limited testing, but we believe this should be set to prevent rendering corruption, therefore cc stable.  v1: Clear bit 4 also (Ken + Eugeni) Do a full clear + set of the bits we want (Me).

"statistics: draw legend as a QSGNode  In order not to waste CPU by constantly rerendering the chart, we must use these weird OpenGL QSGNode things. The interface is appallingly low-level and unfriendly.  As a first test, try to convert the legend. Create a wrapper class that represents a rectangular item with a texture and that will certainly need some (lots of) optimization.  Make sure that all low-level QSG-objects are only accessed in the rendering thread. This means that the wrapper has to maintain a notion of ""dirtiness"" of the state. I.e. which part of the QSG-objects have to be modified.  From the low-level wrapper derive a class that draws a rounded rectangle for every resize. The child class of that must then paint on the rectangle after every resize.  That looks all not very fortunate, but it displays a legend and will make it possible to move the legend without and drawing operations, only shifting around an OpenGL surface.  The render thread goes through all chart-items and rerenders them if dirty. Currently, on deletion of these items, this list is not reset. I.e. currently it is not supported to remove individual items. Only the full scene can be cleared!",0,1

"mm: compaction: partially revert capture of suitable high-order page  Eric Wong reported on 3.7 and 3.8-rc2 that ppoll() got stuck when waiting for POLLIN on a local TCP socket.  It was easier to trigger if there was disk IO and dirty pages at the same time and he bisected it to commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 (""mm: compaction: capture a suitable high-order page immediately when it is made available"").  The intention of that patch was to improve high-order allocations under memory pressure after changes made to reclaim in 3.6 drastically hurt THP allocations but the approach was flawed.  For Eric, the problem was that page->pfmemalloc was not being cleared for captured pages leading to a poor interaction with swap-over-NFS support causing the packets to be dropped.  However, I identified a few more problems with the patch including the fact that it can increase contention on zone->lock in some cases which could result in async direct compaction being aborted early.  In retrospect the capture patch took the wrong approach.  What it should have done is mark the pageblock being migrated as MIGRATE_ISOLATE if it was allocating for THP and avoided races that way.  While the patch was showing to improve allocation success rates at the time, the benefit is marginal given the relative complexity and it should be revisited from scratch in the context of the other reclaim-related changes that have taken place since the patch was first written and tested.  This patch partially reverts commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 (""mm: compaction: capture a suitable high-order page immediately when it is made available"").",0,0

"futex: Handle futex_pi OWNER_DIED take over correctly  Siddhesh analyzed a failure in the take over of pi futexes in case the owner died and provided a workaround. See: [URL]/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14076  The detailed problem analysis shows:  Futex F is initialized with PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT and PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP attributes.  T1 lock_futex_pi(F);  T2 lock_futex_pi(F);    --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated        to T1.  T1 exits    --> exit_robust_list() runs        --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and            FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.  T3 lock_futex_pi(F);    --> Succeeds due to the check for F's userspace TID field == 0    --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the        userspace TID field of futex F    --> returns to user space  T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()        --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes T2 via        	   rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)  T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains real ownership of the        pi_state    --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the        userspace TID field of futex F    --> returns to user space  T3 --> observes inconsistent state  This problem is independent of UP/SMP, preemptible/non preemptible kernels, or process shared vs. private. The only difference is that certain configurations are more likely to expose it.  So as Siddhesh correctly analyzed the following check in futex_lock_pi_atomic() is the culprit:  	if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) {  We check the userspace value for a TID value of 0 and take over the futex unconditionally if that's true.  AFAICT this check is there as it is correct for a different corner case of futexes: the WAITERS bit became stale.  Now the proposed change  -	if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) { +       if (unlikely(ownerdied || +                       !(curval & (FUTEX_TID_MASK | FUTEX_WAITERS)))) {  solves the problem, but it's not obvious why and it wreckages the ""stale WAITERS bit"" case.  What happens is, that due to the WAITERS bit being set (T2 is blocked on that futex) it enforces T3 to go through lookup_pi_state(), which in the above case returns an existing pi_state and therefor forces T3 to legitimately fight with T2 over the ownership of the pi_state (via pi_state->mutex). Probelm solved!  Though that does not work for the ""WAITERS bit is stale"" problem because if lookup_pi_state() does not find existing pi_state it returns -ERSCH (due to TID == 0) which causes futex_lock_pi() to return -ESRCH to user space because the OWNER_DIED bit is not set.  Now there is a different solution to that problem. Do not look at the user space value at all and enforce a lookup of possibly available pi_state. If pi_state can be found, then the new incoming locker T3 blocks on that pi_state and legitimately races with T2 to acquire the rt_mutex and the pi_state and therefor the proper ownership of the user space futex.  lookup_pi_state() has the correct order of checks. It first tries to find a pi_state associated with the user space futex and only if that fails it checks for futex TID value = 0. If no pi_state is available nothing can create new state at that point because this happens with the hash bucket lock held.  So the above scenario changes to:  T1 lock_futex_pi(F);  T2 lock_futex_pi(F);    --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated        to T1.  T1 exits    --> exit_robust_list() runs        --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and            FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.  T3 lock_futex_pi(F);    --> Finds pi_state and blocks on pi_state->rt_mutex  T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()        --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes it via        	   rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)  T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains ownership of the pi_state    --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the        userspace TID field of futex F    --> returns to user space  This covers all gazillion points on which T3 might come in between T1's exit_robust_list() clearing the TID field and T2 fixing it up. It also solves the ""WAITERS bit stale"" problem by forcing the take over.  Another benefit of changing the code this way is that it makes it less dependent on untrusted user space values and therefor minimizes the possible wreckage which might be inflicted.  As usual after staring for too long at the futex code my brain hurts so much that I really want to ditch that whole optimization of avoiding the syscall for the non contended case for PI futexes and rip out the maze of corner case handling code. Unfortunately we can't as user space relies on that existing behaviour, but at least thinking about it helps me to preserve my mental sanity. Maybe we should nevertheless :)  Reported-and-tested-by: Siddhesh Poyarekar [URL]> Link:   Acked-by: Darren Hart [URL]>",0,0

"[Analysis] add isSplatValue() for vectors in IR  We have the related getSplatValue() already in IR (see code just above the proposed addition).

"Register overutilization for arbitrary sequence sizes rework -This update brings generalization of register overutilization technique for arbitrary sequences. With it enabled, bigger sequences can be done in one upload to the chip, effectively bringing shared memory size to 128KB or even 256KB. It trades occupancy for lower number of memory transfers and can be useful for high-end GPUs with high CU count. Works both for non-strided and strided axes. Tested for C2C and single upload mode, no convolutions (will be improved in the future). Enabled for power of 2 sequences by default (works for non-power of 2 sequences as well, but performance gains are not yet tested). -Switched FFT exponent sign to be conformant with FFTW. Added an option to disable normalization in inverse FFT (enabled by default).",0,1

"Add migration support from agent to NSX dhcp/metadata services  This is feature patch (3 of 3) that introduces support for transitioning existing NSX-based deployments from the agent based model of providing dhcp and metadata proxy services to the new agentless based mode. In 'combined' mode, existing networks will still be served by the existing infrastructure, whereas new networks will be served by the new infrastructure.  Networks may be migrated to the model using a new CLI tool provided, called 'neutron-nsx-manage'. Currently the tool provides two admin-only commands:    neutron-nsx-manage net-report <net-id-or-name>  This will check that the network can be migrated and returns the resources currently in use. And:    neutron-nsx-manage net-migrate <net-id-or-name>  This will move the network over the new model and deallocate resources from the agent. Once a network has been migrated there is no turning back.  Completes-blueprint nsx-integrated-services",0,0
Switch index requests to updates with docAsUpsert  Switch all index statements to updates with docAsUpsert to make sure we don't throw out any fields maintained outside the normal index mechanism like local_sites_with_dupe.  This should be safe because the merging mechanism that docAsUpsert uses sits well with us because it won't try to merge lists.  Wonderful!

"arm: vfp: Fix memory corruption on PM suspend  Commit 36af2a47 (""ARM: vfp: Always save VFP state in vfp_pm_suspend"") introduced a potential use-after-free bug. On SMP systems, vfp_current_hw_state might hold dangling pointers in case a task which used the VFP last migrates to another CPU and then exits. If vfp_pm_suspend is called while vfp_current_hw_state still holds a pointer to the freed thread_info, that memory location will be written, potentially overwriting a new object allocated there.  The original problem is only relevant to UP systems in which the VFP state is stored lazily.  Fix this by only storing the VFP state on UP systems, and avoid doing so on SMP ones.",0,0

"ACPI: Fix incompatibility with mcount-based function graph tracing  commit 61b79e16c68d703dde58c25d3935d67210b7d71b upstream.  Paul Menzel reported a warning:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 774 at /build/linux-ROBWaj/linux-4.9.13/kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:233 ftrace_return_to_handler+0x1aa/0x1e0   Bad frame pointer: expected f6919d98, received f6919db0     from func acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake return to c43b6f9d  The warning means that function graph tracing is broken for the acpi_pm_device_sleep_wake() function.  That's because the ACPI Makefile unconditionally sets the '-Os' gcc flag to optimize for size.  That's an issue because mcount-based function graph tracing is incompatible with '-Os' on x86, thanks to the following gcc bug:    [URL]/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42109  I have another patch pending which will ensure that mcount-based function graph tracing is never used with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE on x86.  But this patch is needed in addition to that one because the ACPI Makefile overrides that config option for no apparent reason.  It has had this flag since the beginning of git history, and there's no related comment, so I don't know why it's there.  As far as I can tell, there's no reason for it to be there.  The appropriate behavior is for it to honor CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_{SIZE,PERFORMANCE} like the rest of the kernel.  Reported-by: Paul Menzel < >",0,0

"mm/huge_memory.c: respect FOLL_FORCE/FOLL_COW for thp  commit 8310d48b125d19fcd9521d83b8293e63eb1646aa upstream.  In commit 19be0eaffa3a (""mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()""), the mm code was changed from unsetting FOLL_WRITE after a COW was resolved to setting the (newly introduced) FOLL_COW instead.  Simultaneously, the check in gup.c was updated to still allow writes with FOLL_FORCE set if FOLL_COW had also been set.  However, a similar check in huge_memory.c was forgotten.  As a result, remote memory writes to ro regions of memory backed by transparent huge pages cause an infinite loop in the kernel (handle_mm_fault sets FOLL_COW and returns 0 causing a retry, but follow_trans_huge_pmd bails out immidiately because `(flags & FOLL_WRITE) && !pmd_write(*pmd)` is true.  While in this state the process is stil SIGKILLable, but little else works (e.g.  no ptrace attach, no other signals).  This is easily reproduced with the following code (assuming thp are set to always):      #include <assert.h>     #include <fcntl.h>     #include <stdint.h>     #include <stdio.h>     #include <string.h>     #include <sys/mman.h>     #include <sys/stat.h>     #include <sys/types.h>     #include <sys/wait.h>     #include <unistd.h>      #define TEST_SIZE 5 * 1024 * 1024      int main(void) {       int status;       pid_t child;       int fd = open(""/proc/self/mem"", O_RDWR);       void *addr = mmap(NULL, TEST_SIZE, PROT_READ,                         MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);       assert(addr != MAP_FAILED);       pid_t parent_pid = getpid();       if ((child = fork()) == 0) {         void *addr2 = mmap(NULL, TEST_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,                            MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);         assert(addr2 != MAP_FAILED);         memset(addr2, 'a', TEST_SIZE);         pwrite(fd, addr2, TEST_SIZE, (uintptr_t)addr);         return 0;       }       assert(child == waitpid(child, &status, 0));       assert(WIFEXITED(status) && WEXITSTATUS(status) == 0);       return 0;     }  Fix this by updating follow_trans_huge_pmd in huge_memory.c analogously to the update in gup.c in the original commit.  The same pattern exists in follow_devmap_pmd.  However, we should not be able to reach that check with FOLL_COW set, so add WARN_ONCE to make sure we notice if we ever do.

Also use 95% percentile confidence interval instead of standard deviation in various places.  * resources/results-template.html: Added statistics.js as dependency.

"Merge #13194: Remove template matching and pseudo opcodes  c814e2e7e81fd01fcb07f4a28435741bdc463801 Remove template matching and pseudo opcodes (Pieter Wuille)  Pull request description:    The current code contains a rather complex script template matching engine, which is only used for 3 particular script types (P2PK, P2PKH, multisig). The first two of these are trivial to match for otherwise, and a specialized matcher for multisig is both more compact and more efficient than a generic one.    The goal is being more flexible, so that for example larger standard multisigs inside SegWit outputs are easier to implement.    As a side-effect, it also gets rid of the pseudo opcodes hack.

"From 7bddc2ba16a2a15773c2ea8947059afa27727764 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: Alan Coopersmith <alan.coopersmith at [URL]> Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2013 21:47:16 -0700 Subject: [PATCH] Avoid use-after-free in dix/dixfonts.c: doImageText()  [CVE-2013-4396]  Save a pointer to the passed in closure structure before copying it and overwriting the *c pointer to point to our copy instead of the original.  If we hit an error, once we free(c), reset c to point to the original structure before jumping to the cleanup code that references *c.  Since one of the errors being checked for is whether the server was able to malloc(c->nChars * itemSize), the client can potentially pass a number of characters chosen to cause the malloc to fail and the error path to be taken, resulting in the read from freed memory.  Since the memory is accessed almost immediately afterwards, and the X server is mostly single threaded, the odds of the free memory having invalid contents are low with most malloc implementations when not using memory debugging features, but some allocators will definitely overwrite the memory there, leading to a likely crash.

"Cult Overhaul  Cult is awful, so let's try to improve it. Idea by KorPhaeron. I also took some inspiration from adrix89's sacrifice cult, so credits to him. Also thanks a lot specially to MrPerson and Iamgoofball for helping me brainstorm this, and Joan for the sprites for the summoning orb, the large nar-sie shell, and the new cult antag hud.  Basically, we remove conversion, and turn cult into a magic version of nuke, with a small team of stealth elite cultists that have to build a base in the station and sacrifice people in order to build an army of constructs and get materials to eventually summon Nar-Sie.  Stun talismans and conversion are gone. Nar-Sie is now the only objective. Sacrifice runes now provide summoning orbs, which you can use to drop a large shell. Insert enough orbs in the shell and you trigger a Delta. Defend the shell for 3 minutes and Nar-sie will arise. This shell is bombproof and singularityproof. It may be summoned up to three times if destroyed, but you will have to start from the beginning sac-wise.  Runes are now RNG. Each cultist only gets 50% of the runes. Inspiration is basically The Binding of Isaac here (thank you MrPerson for this!). Furthermore, many old runes were merged/removed and other new ones were added. Almost all were massively rebalanced. Cult now also has a stealthy ritual dagger with high bleeding and throw effects.",0,0
"PM / devfreq: Add cache HW monitor governor  The cache HW monitor devfreq governor uses the hardware counters to determine the load on the cache and the appropriate frequency needed to support that load. This governor can be used in conjunction with the cache devfreq device to dynamically scale the cache frequency based on the demand/actual usage from the CPU subsystem.  The governor is written to be agnostic of the actual counters used to determine the load. On Krait based CPUs, the governor uses the Krait L2 PM counters which can conflict with certain profiling tools.  The Krait L2 performance monitor counters have the capability to count different types of requests going to the L2 cache. They also have the capability to raise interrupts when they overflow. This driver uses those counters to determine the true usage of L2 from the Krait processor subsystem and then recommends L2 frequency based on the measured values and the following tunable parameters.  The driver provides various tunables that allow it to be tuned more in favor of power or performance:  - cycles_per_high_req: The no. of cache clock cycles that are necessary to   efficiently process a high-work request to the cache. A higher value   means higher power and potentially higher performance. A lower value   means lower power and potentially lower performance.  - cycles_per_med_req: The no. of cache clock cycles that are necessary to   efficiently process a medium-work request to the cache. A higher value   means higher power and potentially higher performance. A lower value   means lower power and potentially lower performance.  - polling_ms: The sampling period in milliseconds. This only affects the   sampling period when cache use is ramping down or is increasing very   slowly (See tolerance_mrps).  - min_busy: The minimum percentage of time the cache should be busy. This   is also applied as a lower bound to the measured busy percentage before   it's used in calculations. This has to be lower than or equal to   max_busy. Lower values will make the scaling more aggressive.  - max_busy: The maximum percentage of time the cache should be busy. This   is also applied as an upper bound to the measured busy percentage before   it's used in calculations. This has to be greater than or equal to   min_busy. Lower values will make the scaling more aggressive.  - tolerance_mrps: The minimum increase (in millions of requests per second)   in cache requests, compared to previous sample, that will trigger an IRQ   to immediately re-evaluate the cache frequency.  - decay_rate: The parameter controls the rate at which the history is   forgotten when ramping down. This is expressed as a percentage of history   to be forgotten. So 100% means ignore history, 0% means never forget the   historical max. The default 90% means forget 90% of history each time.  - guard_band_mhz: This is a margin that's added to the computed cache   frequency to account for the time it takes between the load increasing   and the governor/device finishes ramping up the cache frequency.",0,1

KVM: x86: Improve thread safety in pit  commit 2febc839133280d5a5e8e1179c94ea674489dae2 upstream.  There's a race condition in the PIT emulation code in KVM.  In __kvm_migrate_pit_timer the pit_timer object is accessed without synchronization.  If the race condition occurs at the wrong time this can crash the host kernel.  This fixes CVE-2014-3611.,0,0

"Revert ""r225811 - Revert ""r225808 - [PowerPC] Add StackMap/PatchPoint support""""  This re-applies r225808, fixed to avoid problems with SDAG dependencies along with the preceding fix to ScheduleDAGSDNodes::RegDefIter::InitNodeNumDefs. These problems caused the original regression tests to assert/segfault on many (but not all) systems.  Original commit message:  This commit does two things:   1. Refactors PPCFastISel to use more of the common infrastructure for call     lowering (this lets us take advantage of this common code for lowering some     common intrinsics, stackmap/patchpoint among them).   2. Adds support for stackmap/patchpoint lowering. For the most part, this is     very similar to the support in the AArch64 target, with the obvious differences     (different registers, NOP instructions, etc.). The test cases are adapted     from the AArch64 test cases.  One difference of note is that the patchpoint call sequence takes 24 bytes, so you can't use less than that (on AArch64 you can go down to 16). Also, as noted in the docs, we take the patchpoint address to be the actual code address (assuming the call is local in the TOC-sharing sense), which should yield higher performance than generating the full cross-DSO indirect-call sequence and is likely just as useful for JITed code (if not, we'll change it).  StackMaps and Patchpoints are still marked as experimental, and so this support is doubly experimental. So go ahead and experiment!",0,0

"Add both IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options if interface has both  It is possible that an interface has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, primarily when using SLAAC with OpenStack Neutron.  When this is the case, it is very likely that the first fixed IP would be a SLAAC assigned port and the second IP is the IPv4 address.  In an environment where you are looking to boot via IPv4, no DHCPv6 infrastructure exists as IPv6 connectivity is provided via SLAAC, you would not be able to use this network to boot off of.  This patch instead grabs all the fixed IP addresses, then inserts the options that match the IP versions which are attached to the interface, potentially resulting in both IPv4 and IPv6 options being included (though the IPv6 ones would be largely omitted).  In environments where only IPv4 or IPv6 is in use on the port, it will still only insert the options for those specific IP versions.  Story #2008660 Task #41933",0,0

To reproduce it I was doing the following on a single socket I7-based machine with 16G of RAM.  $ hugeadm --pool-pages-max DEFAULT:13G $ echo $((18*1048576*1024)) > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax $ echo $((18*1048576*1024)) > /proc/sys/kernel/shmall $ for i in `seq 1 9000`; do ./hugetlbfs-test; done  On my particular machine, it usually triggers within 10 minutes but enabling debug options can change the timing such that it never hits. Once the bug is triggered, the machine is in trouble and needs to be rebooted.  The machine will respond but processes accessing proc like ""ps aux"" will hang due to the BUG_ON.  shutdown will also hang and needs a hard reset or a sysrq-b.  The basic problem is a race between page table sharing and teardown.  For the most part page table sharing depends on i_mmap_mutex.  In some cases, it is also taking the mm->page_table_lock for the PTE updates but with shared page tables, it is the i_mmap_mutex that is more important.  Unfortunately it appears to be also insufficient. Consider the following situation  Process A					Process B ---------					--------- hugetlb_fault					shmdt   						LockWrite(mmap_sem)     						  do_munmap 						    unmap_region 						      unmap_vmas 						        unmap_single_vma 						          unmap_hugepage_range       						            Lock(i_mmap_mutex) 							    Lock(mm->page_table_lock) 							    huge_pmd_unshare/unmap tables <--- (1) 							    Unlock(mm->page_table_lock)       						            Unlock(i_mmap_mutex)   huge_pte_alloc				      ...     Lock(i_mmap_mutex)				      ...     vma_prio_walk, find svma, spte		      ...     Lock(mm->page_table_lock)			      ...     share spte					      ...     Unlock(mm->page_table_lock)			      ...     Unlock(i_mmap_mutex)			      ...   hugetlb_no_page									  <--- (2) 						      free_pgtables 						        unlink_file_vma 							hugetlb_free_pgd_range 						    remove_vma_list  In this scenario, it is possible for Process A to share page tables with Process B that is trying to tear them down.  The i_mmap_mutex on its own does not prevent Process A walking Process B's page tables.  At (1) above, the page tables are not shared yet so it unmaps the PMDs.  Process A sets up page table sharing and at (2) faults a new entry.  Process B then trips up on it in free_pgtables.  This patch fixes the problem by adding a new function __unmap_hugepage_range_final that is only called when the VMA is about to be destroyed.  This function clears VM_MAYSHARE during unmap_hugepage_range() under the i_mmap_mutex.  This makes the VMA ineligible for sharing and avoids the race.  Superficially this looks like it would then be vunerable to truncate and madvise issues but hugetlbfs has its own truncate handlers so does not use unmap_mapping_range() and does not support madvise(DONTNEED).  This should be treated as a -stable candidate if it is merged.  Test program is as follows. The test case was mostly written by Michal Hocko with a few minor changes to reproduce this bug.  ==== CUT HERE ====  static size_t huge_page_size = (2UL << 20); static size_t nr_huge_page_A = 512; static size_t nr_huge_page_B = 5632;  unsigned int get_random(unsigned int max) { 	struct timeval tv;  	gettimeofday(&tv, NULL); 	srandom(tv.tv_usec); 	return random() % max; }  static void play(void *addr, size_t size) { 	unsigned char *start = addr, 		      *end = start + size, 		      *a; 	start += get_random(size/2);  	/* we could itterate on huge pages but let's give it more time. */ 	for (a = start; a < end; a += 4096) 		*a = 0; }  int main(int argc, char **argv) { 	key_t key = IPC_PRIVATE; 	size_t sizeA = nr_huge_page_A * huge_page_size; 	size_t sizeB = nr_huge_page_B * huge_page_size; 	int shmidA, shmidB; 	void *addrA = NULL, *addrB = NULL; 	int nr_children = 300, n = 0;  	if ((shmidA = shmget(key, sizeA, IPC_CREAT|SHM_HUGETLB|0660)) == -1) { 		perror(""shmget:""); 		return 1; 	}  	if ((addrA = shmat(shmidA, addrA, SHM_R|SHM_W)) == (void *)-1UL) { 		perror(""shmat""); 		return 1; 	} 	if ((shmidB = shmget(key, sizeB, IPC_CREAT|SHM_HUGETLB|0660)) == -1) { 		perror(""shmget:""); 		return 1; 	}  	if ((addrB = shmat(shmidB, addrB, SHM_R|SHM_W)) == (void *)-1UL) { 		perror(""shmat""); 		return 1; 	}  fork_child: 	switch(fork()) { 		case 0: 			switch (n%3) { 			case 0: 				play(addrA, sizeA); 				break; 			case 1: 				play(addrB, sizeB); 				break; 			case 2: 				break; 			} 			break; 		case -1: 			perror(""fork:""); 			break; 		default: 			if (++n < nr_children) 				goto fork_child; 			play(addrA, sizeA); 			break; 	} 	shmdt(addrA); 	shmdt(addrB); 	do { 		wait(NULL); 	} while (--n > 0); 	shmctl(shmidA, IPC_RMID, NULL); 	shmctl(shmidB, IPC_RMID, NULL); 	return 0; }  [URL]: name the declaration's args, fix CONFIG_HUGETLBFS=n build]",0,0

"perf script: Enable printing of branch stack  This patch improves perf script by enabling printing of the branch stack via the 'brstack' and 'brstacksym' arguments to the field selection option -F. The option is off by default and operates only if the perf.data file has branch stack content.  The branches are printed in to/from pairs. The most recent branch is printed first. The number of branch entries vary based on the underlying hardware and filtering used.  The brstack prints FROM/TO addresses in raw hexadecimal format. The brstacksym prints FROM/TO addresses in symbolic form wherever possible.   $ perf script -F ip,brstack   5d3000 0x401aa0/0x5d2000/M/-/-/-/0 ...   $ perf script -F ip,brstacksym   4011e0 noploop+0x0/noploop+0x0/P/-/-/0  The notation F/T/M/X/A/C describes the attributes of the branch.

arm: irq: warn only when affinity really breaks  Following change causes unnecessary warnings printed for those IRQ's which are affine to several CPU's when one of these CPU's is taken off line. It shouldn't be considered a broken affinity when one online CPU can satisfy the IRQ's affinity preference.  commit 5bfaecc21018973f73bc4dc839699848b448c0e7 Author: Praveen Chidambaram [URL]> Date:   Mon Jun 23 08:58:08 2014 -0600  arm: irq: Notify affinity change when migrating IRQs during hotplug  Hotplug causes IRQs affine to a core that is being taken down to migrate to an online core. This is done by directly calling the irq_set_affinity associated with the irq_chip structure. Instead using the irq_set_affinity() api lets the notifications bubble through.,0,0
